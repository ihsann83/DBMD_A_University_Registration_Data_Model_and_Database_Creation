# DBMD_A_University_Registration_Data_Model_and_Database_Creation

I designed the University Registration Data Model according to the Crow's Food model by 
using Draw.io. The model has several parts, beginning with an ERD and followed by a 
written description of entity types, constraints, and assumptions.

I Used the provided DraftFile_UniversityDB.sql file because it has additional tasks and 
directions.

I created database tables according to my data model. I created the necessary indexes in 
the tables. I built relationships between tables using the keys. I used data types for table 
fields. I created the appropriate constraints in the tables.

I created the data model correctly and transferred the data to the tables correctly in order to create a normalized database,
